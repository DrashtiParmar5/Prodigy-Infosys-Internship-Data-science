# 📊 Population Analysis — Task 1 (Internship Project)

This project is part of my ongoing internship where I was assigned the task of analyzing global population data. The objective of **Task 1** was to extract meaningful insights related to total, male, and female populations across countries for the year 2022 and visualize key patterns using Python.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Information

The dataset used in this task is [`worldpopulationdata.csv`](./data/worldpopulationdata.csv), which contains comprehensive global population statistics including:
- Total population
- Male population
- Female population
- Year-wise records
- Series codes (e.g., `SP.POP.TOTL`, `SP.POP.TOTL.MA.IN`, etc.)

---

## ✅ Task Objectives

1. Filter the dataset based on:
   - **Total population**
   - **Male population**
   - **Female population**

2. Identify the **top 10 countries** in each category based on 2022 data.

3. Visualize the results using bar charts:
   - Total population by country (2022)
   - Total population by country (2016)
   - Comparison of male vs female population in top 10 countries

4. Calculate:
   - Overall **total male** and **total female** population globally for 2020

## 📈 Visualizations

The following visualizations were generated using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`:

- 📊 Bar plot of top 10 countries by total population (2022 & 2016)
- 👨‍👩‍👧 Side-by-side comparison of male vs female population in top countries
- 🌍 Global male and female population totals for 2020

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** for data analysis
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for experimentation and exploration

## 📌 Key Learnings

- Improved my ability to clean and filter large datasets using pandas
- Practiced creating meaningful and clear visualizations
- Understood how to interpret population trends across time and gender
